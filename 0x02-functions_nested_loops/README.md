# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## Overview
This project, held from October 10, 2023, to October 11, 2023, emphasizes the use of functions and nested loops in C programming. It introduces students to the basics of function usage, scope of variables, and complex looping mechanisms.

## Resources

### Read or Watch:
- Nested while loops
- C - Functions
- Learning to Program in C (Part 06) up to 14:00
- Purpose of a function prototype
- C - Header Files (up to "Once-Only Headers" paragraph)

### Additional Resources:
- C Programming Loops & Functions
- Functions in C programming

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- How to implement and use nested loops
- Function usage, including declarations and definitions
- The difference between a function's declaration and its definition
- What a prototype is and its purpose
- The scope of variables in functions
- The use of gcc flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`
- How and why to use header files with `#include`

## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files must end with a new line
- Adherence to the Betty coding style is required
- Global variables are prohibited
- Limit of 5 functions per file
- Standard library functions (e.g., `printf`, `puts`) are forbidden; `_putchar` is allowed
- Include all function prototypes in a header file called `main.h`
