# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

This project, part of the Holberton School curriculum, focuses on understanding and implementing various search algorithms in C.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what a search algorithm is.
- Implement linear search.
- Implement binary search.
- Determine the best search algorithm to use based on specific needs.

## Requirements

- All files must compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Code should adhere to the [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki).
- No use of global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Restricted to using the `printf` function from the standard library. Other standard library functions like `strdup`, `malloc`, etc., are forbidden.
- The prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file named `search_algos.h`.
- All header files should have include guards.

## Mandatory Tasks

- **Task 0**: Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.
- **Task 1**: Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.

## Advanced Tasks

- **Task 2**: Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Jump search algorithm.

## Big O Notation

Each search algorithm should include the time complexity (Big O notation) associated with it. These notations describe the performance or complexity of the algorithm in terms of input size.

## Usage

Examples for testing each function will be included in the project directory. These are for verification purposes and will not be included in the final submission.
