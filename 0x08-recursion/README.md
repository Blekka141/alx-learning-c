# 0x08. C - Recursion

Explore the concept of recursion in C programming through this ALX School project. Recursion, a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem, is a fundamental concept in computer science and software development.

## Project Details
**Weight:** 1  
**Project Duration:** Oct 25, 2023, 6:00 AM to Oct 26, 2023, 6:00 AM  
**Deadline:** An auto review will be launched at the deadline

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What recursion is and how it can be implemented in C
- Appropriate situations for using recursion
- Situations where recursion should not be used

## General Requirements
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Coding Style:** Code should adhere to Betty style, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **Restrictions:** 
  - No global variables
  - No more than 5 functions per file
  - No use of the standard library. Functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc. are forbidden
  - Use of `_putchar` is allowed
  - Do not use loops or static variables in your code
- **Documentation:** A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Header File:** All function prototypes must be included in your header file called `main.h`

## Quiz Questions
Explore these conceptual questions to test your understanding of recursion:

1. **Incremental Recursion:** What output does the following recursive function produce when starting with `nb = 4`?
   - Outputs a sequence of incremented numbers until 9.

2. **Decremental Recursion:** What is the result of this decremental recursive function starting with `nb = 2`?
   - Outputs the numbers 2 followed by 1.

3. **Complex Recursion:** Analyze this complex recursive function that mixes recursion with arithmetic operations starting from `nb = 4`.
   - Analyze how the recursive addition impacts the output sequence.

4. **Simple Decremental Recursion:** What does a basic decremental recursive function print starting with `nb = 4`?
   - Prints the numbers 4 to 1 in descending order.

5. **Boundary Recursion:** What does this boundary checking recursive function print starting from `nb = 4`?
   - Prints from 4 down to 0, demonstrating a simple countdown.

### Header File Reminder
Ensure to include and push your `main.h` header file, which should list all necessary function prototypes, including that of `_putchar`.

Happy Coding!
