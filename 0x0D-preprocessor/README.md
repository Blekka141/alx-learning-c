# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding the preprocessor phase in C programming, exploring the use of macros, preprocessor directives, and include guards. The project was completed over a period from November 6, 2023, to November 7, 2023.

## Learning Objectives

### General
At the end of this project, students should be able to:
- Define what macros are and how to use them effectively.
- Identify and use the most common predefined macros in C.
- Implement include guards in header files to prevent double inclusion.

## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs.
- **Environment:** All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Each file should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
- Code should adhere to the Betty style and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Global variables are forbidden.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., is forbidden.
- Allowed to use `_putchar`.
- Donâ€™t have to push `_putchar.c`, a file will be used during compilation.
- Main.c files are provided to test functions, but will not be pushed to the repo; they are for personal use.
- Function prototypes should be included in the header file `main.h`.
- All header files should have include guards.
