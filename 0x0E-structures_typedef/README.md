# 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

## Overview
This project delves into the usage of structures and the `typedef` keyword in C programming, covering their application, benefits, and best practices. The project spanned from November 6, 2023, to November 7, 2023.

## Learning Objectives

### General
After completing this project, learners should be able to explain:
- The purpose of structures in C, and scenarios for their use.
- The process and advantages of using `typedef` for type simplification and clarity.

## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment:** All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Files must terminate with a newline.
- A mandatory `README.md` file must be present at the root of the project directory.
- Code should adhere to the Betty coding style.
- The use of global variables is prohibited.
- A maximum of 5 functions per file is allowed.
- Permitted C standard library functions are `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`.
- Usage of `_putchar` is allowed; the file will be provided during compilation.
- Example `main.c` files are provided for testing and are not required for submission.
- Function prototypes should be included in the header file `main.h`, and all header files must be guarded.
