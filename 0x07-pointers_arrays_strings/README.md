# 0x07. C - Even More Pointers, Arrays and Strings

This ALX School project further explores the complexity of pointers, multidimensional arrays, and string manipulation in C. It builds upon the foundational knowledge from previous modules, introducing advanced data structure concepts.

## Project Details
**Weight:** 1  
**Project Duration:** Oct 23, 2023, 6:00 AM to Oct 24, 2023, 6:00 AM  
**Deadline:** An auto review will be launched at the deadline

## Resources
### Read or watch:
- C - Pointer to Pointer
- C â€“ Pointer to Pointer with example
- Multi-dimensional Arrays in C
- Two dimensional (2D) arrays in C programming with example

### Additional Resources
- [Arrays, Strings & Pointers in C Programming](#)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- The usage and utility of pointers to pointers
- How to effectively utilize multidimensional arrays
- Common C standard library functions for string manipulation

## General Requirements
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Coding Style:** Code should adhere to Betty style, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **Restrictions:** 
  - No global variables
  - No more than 5 functions per file
  - No use of the standard library, including functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc.
  - Usage of `_putchar` is allowed
  - Do not push `_putchar.c`; it will be provided during compilation
- **Documentation:** A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Header File:** All function prototypes must be included in a header file called `main.h`

## Quiz Questions
Here are some conceptual questions to test foundational understanding:

1. **Pointer Size:** What is the size of a pointer to a pointer to an int on a 64-bit architecture?
   - 8 bytes

2. **2D Array Access:** In a 5x2 array initialized as `int a[5][2] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8}, {9, 10}};`, what is the value of `a[1][1]`?
   - 4

3. **Pointer Content:** What does a pointer to a pointer to an int store?
   - An address where an address is stored

4. **Multidimensional Array Value:** What is the value of `a[3][1]` in the same array?
   - 8

### Header File Reminder
Ensure to include and push your `main.h` header file, which should list all necessary function prototypes, including that of `_putchar`.

Happy Coding!
